Assumptions: 
1. Legal age is 18 but since there was no mention about the age range in the requirement, the code will accept any entry between age 1 and age 150. 
2. It is assumed that customer details (name, age, date of birth, etc.) are not required to be saved/stored in a database. 
3. It is assumed that OccupationRatings and RatingFactors need to be stored in database so that they could be changed from time to time. 

Clarifications: 
Following items could be improved if I could spend another day on this prototype: 
1. Validation
2. Unit testing - There was an issue with my Visual Studio today (18/7/21) when trying to add the unit test project. 
3. Presentation (UI) 
4. Documentation
5. Comments
