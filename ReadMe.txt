Assumptions: 
1. Legal age is 18 but since there was no mention about the age range in the requirement, the code will accept any entry between age 1 and age 150. 
2. It is assumed that customer details (name, age, date of birth, etc.) are not required to be saved/stored in a database. 
3. It is assumed that OccupationRatings and RatingFactors need to be stored in database so that they could be changed from time to time. 
4. Total Value is not required to be rounded.

Things that can be improved: 
Following items could be improved if I could spend another day on this prototype: 
1. Validation - Validation can be improved 
2. Unit testing - More unit tests can be added to test the controllers and business logic
3. Customer details are saved in Customer table when the Calculate button is pressed.
This feature is not requested in the requirement. This is for the future use and this is done to be able to retrieve the details back by passing in the Customer ID on the Page 1 and Page 2 of the Calculator. 
Customer data retrival was partially done. Need more time to complete this function.

Clarification: 
1. Unit Tests - There was an issue with adding unit test project to GitHub. Stil trying to resolve it. May need to use submodules to check-in the unit test project.
