Assumptions: 
1. Legal age is 18 but since there was no mention about the age range in the requirement, the code will accept any entry between age 1 and age 150. 
2. It is assumed that customer details (name, age, date of birth, etc.) are not required to be saved/stored in a database. 
3. It is assumed that OccupationRatings and RatingFactors need to be stored in database so that they could be changed from time to time.
